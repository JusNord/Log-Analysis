# Python Email Sender Script

## Overview

This Python script provides a simple way to send emails programmatically using Python's `smtplib` module. It's designed to be used in scenarios where automated email sending is required, such as sending notifications or alerts from a Python application.

## Features

- Sends emails using SMTP protocol.
- Configurable sender and receiver email addresses.
- Securely inputs and uses email password.
- Customizable email subject and message body.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Access to an SMTP server (the script is configured for Gmail's SMTP server).
- Internet connection.

## Setup

### Installing Python

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Script Configuration

1. **Email Credentials:**
   - Replace `your_email@gmail.com` with your Gmail address.
   - Replace `receiver_email@example.com` with the recipient's email address.
   - It's recommended to use environment variables or prompt input for the password for security reasons.

2. **Using Environment Variables for Password (Recommended):**
   - On Windows, set an environment variable in Command Prompt:
     ```
     set EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
     ```
   - On Linux/MacOS, set an environment variable in Terminal:
     ```
     export EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
     ```
   - In the script, replace `"your_password"` with `os.environ.get("EMAIL_PASSWORD")`.

### Enabling Less Secure Apps (If Necessary)

If you use Gmail and have not enabled "Less Secure App Access," you may need to enable this in your Google account settings to allow the script to send emails. However, it's safer to use App Passwords or OAuth2 authentication for Gmail.

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```
python email_sender.py
```

The script will send an email based on the specified sender and receiver information and the provided subject and message.

## Security and Privacy

- Do not share your email password or store it directly in the script.
- Be cautious when sending sensitive information via email.
- Regularly update your email password and use a strong, unique password.

## Contributions

Contributions to this script are welcome. Please ensure to follow best practices for code style and security.
